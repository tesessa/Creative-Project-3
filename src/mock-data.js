Afterwards I did more homework and then went to a dinner mystery party with the relief society. I was Flora Florida, an underage contestant of the American beauty pageant and the suspected murderer of Tina Texas (Oprah Oklahoma was the real murderer). Then I came back to my apartment and watched movies with my roomates"

My dad made me waffles with strawberries and then my mom and I shopped for clothes. For lunch I had Panera Bread with Austin, Noah, dad, and Nick. That night I opened presents, had cake, and spaghetti for dinner."
